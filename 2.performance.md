# 3 Key Performance
Client Side (Front End)
- Critical Render Path
- Optimized Code 
- Progressive Web App

Netword
- Minimize Files
- Minimize Delivery

Back End
- CDNS
- Caching
- Load Balancing
- DB Scaling
- GZIP

 # Network Performance
 To reduce network time when loading file from website we need to reduce size of html css js and images. Here some way we can use:
 - JavaScript minifier (remove white space)
 - Buid Progress (using webpack to minize files)

About image: primary way to change image size it is change file format. JPG dont allow transparency, PNG or GIF can do that SVG it vector format file. So best file format it is PNG.

Minimize Images:
- Transparency: PNG
- Animation: GIF
- Coluful: JPG
- Simple icon, logo SVG
- Reduce PNG with TinyPNG
- Reduce JPG with TinyJPG
- Always lower JPG image quality (30-60%)
- Resize Image based on size it will displayed
- Use CDN like imigx
- Remove image metadata
- Display different size images for different backgrounds (user media query)

Delivery Optimizations:
- Reduce file load when load website.
- Dont need use library like jQuery
- Put enough number of images, js, ...
- Limit number files when loading after minimize files

Critical Render
- When we get a request to website. HTML will arrive first after that they created a DOM, DOM is describe content of this page. After that they ask for css file. When HTML create DOM (Document Object Model) during that time CSS created CSSOM (CSS Object Model) attack to the DOM. And get JS from server and read execute JS. Browser with combine DOM and CSS created render tree. When every ready we have a fully loaded website. And Image will download on the background when it ready they will appread on screen.

# Critical Render Path 1
- When a user request a website, browser will load external js, css, image
- After reading the document it will creating DOM
- Usually CSS Javascript files take high priority and other files like images take lower.
- The way to opitimize: Load css files as soon as posible and script javascript files as late as possible. (One main principles of CSS performance is to get CSS browser as soon as possible because Javascript requires CSS parsing to finish beforce it can be run, if we put javascript on head tag, they will block page rendering so we need to put CSS on head tag, Javascript at the bottom)

# Critical Render Path 2 Sumary:
- Load style tag in the <headd>
- Load script right before <body> (some exception like google analytics)
- Only load whatever is need. (because we need to wait DOM create after that we need to combine with CSS and render a page or write INTERNAL CSS or INLINE CSS)
- Above the fold loading (only loading the main page, below that dont need to load on the first time - chỉ load những nội dung mà chúng ta thấy được)
- Using media attributes (load css on each screen size)
- Less Specificity (viết class hoặc id ít phụ thuộc hơn (selector ngắn gọn))

# Critical Render Path 3 Sumary:
- Load Scripts asynchronously (not use async if script manipula the DOM, use to load external script that require no knowledge of our code or not affect user experience)
- Defer loading of scripts (same with async best option to use it Google Analytics or tracking scripts)
- Minimize DOM manipulation (do not try manipulat the DOM when loading website)
- Avoid long running script (no running complex script when loading website example like alert)

# Critical Render Path 4 Sumary:
- Limit affect when user interact with my web page.

1. View main thread activities in a table to sort activities based on which ones took up the most time.

2. Analyze frames per second (FPS) to measure whether your animations truly run smoothly.

3. Monitor CPU usage, JS heap size, DOM nodes, layouts per second, and more in real-time with the Performance Monitor.

4. Capture screenshots while recording to play back exactly how the page looked while the page loaded, or an animation fired, and so on.

5. View interactions to quickly identify what happened on a page after a user interacted with it.

6. Find scroll performance issues in real-time by highlighting the page whenever a potentially problematic listener fires.

7. View paint events in real-time to identify costly paint events that may be harming the performance of your animations.
8. View main thread activity to view every event that occurred on the main thread while you were recording.

Additional image manipulation tools:

XNConvert: This free, cross-platform tool can handle batched images, and performs resizing, optimization, and other transforms.

ImageOptim: This free tool is available for Mac and as an online service, and is specifically aimed at optimizing images for speed, including metadata removal (discussed above).

ResizeIt: A Mac-only desktop product that lets you change the size of multiple images simultaneously, and can convert file formats at the same time.

PicResize: One of several good browser-based tools that gives you lots of options for cropping, rotating, resizing, adding effects to, and converting images.

Gimp: This ever-popular cross-platform tool just gets better with age. Powerful and flexible, Gimp lets you perform a wide variety of image manipulation tasks including, of course, resizing.
