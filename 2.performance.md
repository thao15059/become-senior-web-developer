# 3 Key Performance
Client Side (Front End)
- Critical Render Path
- Optimized Code 
- Progressive Web App

Netword
- Minimize Files
- Minimize Delivery

Back End
- CDNS
- Caching
- Load Balancing
- DB Scaling
- GZIP

 # Network Performance
 To reduce network time when loading file from website we need to reduce size of html css js and images. Here some way we can use:
 - JavaScript minifier (remove white space)
 - Buid Progress (using webpack to minize files)

About image: primary way to change image size it is change file format. JPG dont allow transparency, PNG or GIF can do that SVG it vector format file. So best file format it is PNG.

Minimize Images:
- Transparency: PNG
- Animation: GIF
- Coluful: JPG
- Simple icon, logo SVG
- Reduce PNG with TinyPNG
- Reduce JPG with TinyJPG
- Always lower JPG image quality (30-60%)
- Resize Image based on size it will displayed
- Use CDN like imigx
- Remove image metadata
- Display different size images for different backgrounds (user media query)

Delivery Optimizations:
- Reduce file load when load website.
- Dont need use library like jQuery
- Put enough number of images, js, ...
- Limit number files when loading after minimize files

Critical Render
- When we get a request to website. HTML will arrive first after that they created a DOM, DOM is describe content of this page. After that they ask for css file. When HTML create DOM (Document Object Model) during that time CSS created CSSOM (CSS Object Model) attack to the DOM. And get JS from server and read execute JS. Browser with combine DOM and CSS created render tree. When every ready we have a fully loaded website. And Image will download on the background when it ready they will appread on screen.

Critical Render Path 1
- When a user request a website, browser will load external js, css, image
- After reading the document it will creating DOM
- Usually CSS Javascript files take high priority and other files like images take lower.
- The way to opitimize: Load css files as soon as posible and script javascript files as late as possible. (One main principles of CSS performance is to get CSS browser as soon as possible because Javascript requires CSS parsing to finish beforce it can be run, if we put javascript on head tag, they will block page rendering so we need to put CSS on head tag, Javascript at the bottom)

# Sumary:
- Load style tag in the <headd>
- Load script right before <body>
