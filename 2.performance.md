 # Network Performance
 To reduce network time when loading file from website we need to reduce size of html css js and images. Here some way we can use:
 - JavaScript minifier (remove white space)
 - Buid Progress (using webpack to minize files)

About image: primary way to change image size it is change file format. JPG dont allow transparency, PNG or GIF can do that SVG it vector format file. So best file format it is PNG.

Minimize Images:
- Transparency: PNG
- Animation: GIF
- Coluful: JPG
- Simple icon, logo SVG
- Reduce PNG with TinyPNG
- Reduce JPG with TinyJPG
- Always lower JPG image quality (30-60%)
- Resize Image based on size it will displayed
- Use CDN like imigx
- Remove image metadata
- Display different size images for different backgrounds (user media query)

Delivery Optimizations:
- Reduce file load when load website.
- Dont need use library like jQuery
- Put enough number of images, js, ...
- Limit number files when loading after minimize files
